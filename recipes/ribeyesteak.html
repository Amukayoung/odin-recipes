        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This grilled tomahawk steak recipe is a showstopper, ideal for sharing with friends and family. This reverse-seared steak is cooked to perfection with an unctuous compound butter filled with shallots, garlic, and chives. I like to use a Bluetooth-enabled meat thermometer to help me achieve the perfect medium-rare internal temperature.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make steak rub, place brown sugar, Montreal steak seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder in a small airtight container; shake or stir to combine. Set aside 2 teaspoons steak rub to use in compound butter.</li>
            <li>Place steak on a half sheet pan, and rub steak on top, bottom, and sides with remaining steak rub until well coated. Place steak, uncovered, in the refrigerator to dry-brine overnight.</li>
            <li>For compound butter, place butter, shallot, garlic, chives, and the reserved 2 teaspoons steak rub in a small bowl. Mash together with a fork until evenly combined. Spoon butter into a small airtight container, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
            <li>Remove steak from the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking to take the chill off. It will cook on the sheet pan that you used for dry-brining.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). The reverse sear method is used to cook this big steak, so you will need an instant-read thermometer. If you are using a digital meat thermometer, set the internal temperature to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bake steak on the sheet pan in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 110 degrees F (43 degrees C), about 45 minutes. Begin checking the temperature at 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>During the last 15 to 20 minutes of cooking time, preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>When steak reaches an internal temperature of  110 degrees F (43 degrees C) measured with an instant-read thermometer, remove it from the oven.</li>
            <li>Grill steak directly on the grates of the preheated grill; sear on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. This is a fatty piece of meat, so be mindful of flame flare-ups. The internal temperature should now read 125 to 135 degrees F (51 to 57 degrees C) for medium rare.</li>
